European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that 27 EU leaders meeting in Brussels “endorsed the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU-UK relations.” The 27 leaders of the bloc met without Mrs May to endorse the agreement, which sets the stage for Britain exit from the bloc on March 29.</p>

The agreement leaves Britain outside the EU with no say but still subject to its rules and the obligations of membership at least until the end of 2020, possibly longer.</p>

Now Mrs May faces the tough task of getting the deal approved by a sceptical UK Parliament. </p>
